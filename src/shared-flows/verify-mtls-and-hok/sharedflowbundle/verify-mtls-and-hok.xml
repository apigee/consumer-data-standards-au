    <Description>Verifies that mtls is used (not enfoced in testing envs) and, optionally, that the client certificate being used is the same that was used when the client requested a token. In non-production environments this test can be bypassed by using a non-mtls enabled virtual host. In production environments, proxies protected by mTLS with HoK should ONLY be associated with the secure-mtls virtual host</Description>
