# Apigee OIDC Mock Provider

This repo contains a standalone Open ID Connect Identity Provider, ready to deploy to Apigee using Hosted Targets.

It leverages [oidc-provider](https://github.com/panva/node-oidc-provider)

It has been configured to meet the CDS Security profile, including support of OIDC Hybrid  flow, mandatory claims and scopes, issuing JWT based identity tokens, using Pairwise Pseudonymous Identifier (PPID) for authenticated end users, etc.

**Important:** This is a sample implementation used only to showcase capabilities. Note that tokens are kept in memory and will be lost if the Mock provider is redeployed or not been used in a while. Also, clients are stored in a configuration file. The installation procedure copie the client app key and secret generated by Apigee into this configuration file.
