      summary: Get Transactions For Account
      description: "Obtain transactions for a specific account.


        Some general notes that apply to all end points that retrieve
        transactions:


        - Where multiple transactions are returned, transactions should
        be ordered according to effective date in descending order

        - As the date and time for a transaction can alter depending on
        status and transaction type two separate date/times are included in the
        payload. There are still some scenarios where neither of these time
        stamps is available. For the purpose of filtering and ordering it is
        expected that the data holder will use the â€œeffectiveâ€ date/time
        which will be defined as:

        \ - Posted date/time if available, then

        - Execution date/time if available, then

        - A reasonable date/time nominated by the data holder using
        internal data structures

        - For transaction amounts it should be assumed that a negative
        value indicates a reduction of the available balance on the account
        while a positive value indicates an increase in the available balance on
        the account

        - For aggregated transactions (ie. groups of sub transactions
        reported as a single entry for the account) only the aggregated
        information, with as much consistent information accross the subsidiary
        transactions as possible, is required to be shared"
